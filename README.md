# drynx

# list of things that should be in the readMe:

1. -tags vartime for build and test
2. each encoding has a encode/decode function that is called by the DPs and queriers.


# TODO
1. key switching test
2. crypto_test
3. common_structs_test
4. remove drynx things from unlynx if any --> finish the crypto part, almost everything in drynx should leave and remain in unlynx
5. master travis (make local) should work completely
